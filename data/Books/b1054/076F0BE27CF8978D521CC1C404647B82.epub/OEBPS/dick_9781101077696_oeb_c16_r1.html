<div class="ct"><i><b>CHAPTER XVI</b></i></div>
<div class="ctag1"><i>Relates what became of Oliver Twist after</i>  <br/><i>he had been claimed by Nancy.</i></div>
<div> <br/></div><div class="tx1">THE NARROW STREETS AND COURTS, AT LENGTH, TERMINATED IN a large open space, scattered about which were pens for beasts and other indications of a cattle market. Sikes slackened his pace when they reached this spot, the girl being quite unable to support any longer the rapid rate at which they had hitherto walked. Turning to Oliver, he roughly commanded him to take hold of Nancy’s hand.</div>
<div class="tx">“Do you hear?” growled Sikes, as Oliver hesitated and looked round.</div>
<div class="tx">They were in a dark corner, quite out of the track of passengers. Oliver saw, but too plainly, that resistance would be of no avail. He held out his hand, which Nancy clasped tight in hers.</div>
<div class="tx">“Give me the other,” said Sikes, seizing Oliver’s unoccupied hand. “Here, Bull‘s-eye!”</div>
<div class="tx">The dog looked up, and growled.</div>
<div class="tx">“See here, boy!” said Sikes, putting his other hand to Oliver’s throat; “if he speaks ever so soft a word, hold him! D‘ye mind!”</div>
<div class="tx">The dog growled again; and licking his lips, eyed Oliver as if he were anxious to attach himself to his windpipe without delay.</div>
<div class="tx">“He’s as willing as a Christian, strike me blind if he isn‘t!” said Sikes, regarding the animal with a kind of grim and ferocious approval. “Now, you know what you’ve got to expect, master, so call away as quick as you like; the dog will soon stop that game. Get on, young ’un!”</div>
<div class="tx">Bull‘s-eye wagged his tail in acknowledgement of this unusually endearing form of speech; and, giving vent to another admonitory growl for the benefit of Oliver, led the way onward.</div>
<div class="tx">It was Smithfield that they were crossing, although it might have been Grosvenor Square, for anything Oliver knew to the contrary. The night was dark and foggy. The lights in the shops could scarcely struggle through the heavy mist, which thickened every moment and shrouded the streets and houses in gloom, rendering the strange place still stranger in Oliver’s eyes, and making his uncertainty the more dismal and depressing.</div>
<div class="tx">They had hurried on a few paces when a deep church-bell-struck the hour. With its first stroke, his two conductors stopped and turned their heads in the direction whence the sound proceeded.</div>
<div class="tx">“Eight o‘clock, Bill,” said Nancy, when the bell ceased.</div>
<div class="tx">“What’s the good of telling me that; I can hear it, can’t I!” replied Sikes.</div>
<div class="tx">“I wonder whether <i>they</i> can hear it,” said Nancy.</div>
<div class="tx">“Of course they can,” replied Sikes. “It was Bartlemy time when I was shopped, and there warn’t a penny trumpet in the fair as I couldn’t hear the squeaking on. Arter I was locked up for the night, the row and din outside made the thundering old jail so silent that I could almost have beat my brains out against the iron plates of the door.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Poor fellows!” said Nancy, who still had her face turned towards the quarter in which the bell had sounded. “Oh, Bill such fine young chaps as them!”</div>
<div class="tx">“Yes, that’s all you women think of,” answered Sikes. “Fine young chaps! Well, they’re as good as dead, so it don’t much matter.”</div>
<div class="tx">With this consolation, Mr. Sikes appeared to repress a rising tendency to jealousy, and clasping Oliver’s wrist more firmly, told him to step out again.</div>
<div class="tx">“Wait a minute!” said the girl; “I wouldn’t hurry by if it was you that was coming out to be hung, the next time eight o‘clock struck, Bill. I’d walk round and round the place till I dropped, if the snow was on the ground and I hadn’t a shawl to cover me.”</div>
<div class="tx">“And what good would that do?” inquired the unsentimental Mr. Sikes. “Unless you could pitch over a file and twenty yards of good stout rope, you might as well be walking fifty miles off, or not walking at all, for all the good it would do me. Come on, and don’t stand preaching there.”</div>
<div class="tx">The girl burst into a laugh, drew her shawl more closely round her, and they walked away. But Oliver felt her hand tremble, and, looking up in her face as they passed a gas-lamp, saw that it had turned a deadly white.</div>
<div class="tx">They walked on, by little-frequented and dirty ways, for a full half-hour, meeting very few people, and those appearing from their looks to hold much the same position in society as Mr. Sikes himself. At length they turned into a very filthy narrow street, nearly full of old-clothes shops; the dog running forward, as if conscious that there was no further occasion for his keeping on guard, stopped before the door of a shop that was closed and apparently untenanted; the house was in a ruinous condition; and on the door was nailed a board, intimating that it was to let, which looked as if it had hung there for many years.</div>
<div class="tx">“All right,” cried Sikes, glancing cautiously about.</div>
<div class="tx">Nancy stooped below the shutters, and Oliver heard the sound of a bell. They crossed to the opposite side of the street and stood for a few moments under a lamp. A noise, as if a, sash window were gently raised, and heard; and soon afterwards the door softly opened. Mr. Sikes then seized the terrified boy by the collar with very little ceremony, and all three were quickly inside the house.</div>
<div class="tx">The passage was perfectly dark. They waited while the person who had let them in, chained and barred the door.</div>
<div class="tx">“Anybody here?” inquired Sikes.</div>
<div class="tx">“No,” replied a voice, which Oliver thought he had heard before.</div>
<div class="tx">“Is the old ‘un here?” asked the robber.</div>
<div class="tx">“Yes,” replied the voice, “and precious down in the mouth he has been. Won’t he be glad to see you? Oh, no!”</div>
<div class="tx">The style of this reply, as well as the voice which delivered it, seemed familiar to Oliver’s ears: but it was impossible to distinguish even the form of the speaker in the darkness.</div>
<div class="tx">“Let’s have a glim,” said Sikes, “or we shall go breaking our necks, or treading on the dog. Look after your legs if you do!”</div>
<div class="tx">“Stand still a moment, and I’ll get you one,” replied the voice. The receding footsteps of the speaker were heard; and, in another minute, the form of Mr. John Dawkins, otherwise the artful Dodger, appeared. He bore in his right hand a tallow candle stuck in the end of a cleft stick.</div>
<div class="tx">The young gentleman did not stop to bestow any other mark of recognition upon Oliver than a humorous grin, but, turning away, beckoned the visitors to follow him down a flight of stairs. They crossed an empty kitchen and, opening the door of a low earthy-smelling room, which seemed to have been built in a small back-yard, were received with a shout of laughter.</div>
<div class="tx">“Oh, my wig, my wig!” cried Master Charles Bates, from whose lungs the laughter had proceeded; “Here he is! oh, cry, here he is! Oh, Fagin, look at him! Fagin, do look at him! I can’t bear it; it is such a jolly game, I can’t bear it. Hold me, somebody, while I laugh it out.”</div>
<div class="tx">With this irrepressible ebullition of mirth, Master Bates laid himself flat on the floor and kicked convulsively for five minutes, in an ecstasy of facetious joy. Then jumping to his feet, he snatched the cleft stick from the Dodger and, advancing to Oliver, viewed him round and round, while the Jew, taking off his nightcap, made a great number of low bows to the bewildered boy. The Artful, meantime, who was of a rather saturnine disposition, and seldom gave way to merriment when it interfered with business, rifled Oliver’s pockets with steady assiduity.</div>
<div class="tx">“Look at his togs, Fagin!” said Charley, putting the light so close to his new jacket as nearly to set him on fire. “Look at his togs! Superfine cloth, and the heavy swell cut! Oh, my eye, what a game! And his books, too! Nothing but a gentleman, Fagin!”</div>
<div class="tx">“Delighted to see you looking so well, my dear,” said the Jew, bowing with mock humility. “The Artful shall give you another suit, my dear, for fear you should spoil that Sunday one. Why didn’t you write, my dear; and say you were coming? We’d have got something warm for supper.”</div>
<div class="tx">At this, Master Bates roared again, so loud that Fagin himself relaxed, and even the Dodger smiled; but as the Artful drew forth the five-pound note at that instant, it is doubtful whether the sally or the discovery awakened his merriment.</div>
<div class="tx">“Hallo! what’s that?” inquired Sikes, stepping forward as the Jew seized the note. “That’s mine, Fagin.”</div>
<div class="tx">“No, no, my dear,” said the Jew. “Mine, Bill, mine. You shall have the books.”</div>
<div class="tx">“If that ain’t mine!” said Bill Sikes, putting on his hat with a determined air, “mine and Nancy‘s, that is, I’ll take the boy back again.”</div>
<div class="tx">The Jew started. Oliver started too, though from a very different cause; for he hoped that the dispute might really end in his being taken back.</div>
<div class="tx">“Come! Hand over, will you?” said Sikes.</div>
<div class="tx">“This is hardly fair, Bill; hardly fair, is it, Nancy?” inquired the Jew.</div>
<div class="tx">“Fair, or not fair,” retorted Sikes, “hand over, I tell you! Do you think Nancy and me has got nothing else to do with our precious time but to spend it in scouting arter and kidnapping every young boy as gets grabbed through you? Give it here, you avaricious old skeleton, give it here!”</div>
<div class="tx">With this gentle remonstrance, Mr. Sikes plucked the note from between the Jew’s finger and thumb, and looking the old man coolly in the face, folded it up small and tied it in his neckerchief.</div>
<div class="tx">“That’s for our share of the trouble,” said Sikes; “and not half enough, neither. You may keep the books, if you’re fond of reading. If you a‘n’t, sell ‘em.”</div>
<div class="tx">“They’re very pretty,” said Charley Bates, who, with sundry grimaces, had been affecting to read one of the volumes in question; “beautiful writing, isn’t it, Oliver?” At sight of the dismayed look with which Oliver regarded his tormentors, Master Bates, who was blessed with a lively sense of the ludicrous, fell into another ecstasy, more boisterous than the first.</div>
<div class="tx">“They belong to the old gentleman,” said Oliver, wringing his hands; “to the good, kind, old gentleman who took me into his house, and had me nursed when I was near dying of the fever. Oh, pray send them back; send him back the books and  money. Keep me here all my life long; but pray, pray send them back. He’ll think I stole them; the old lady—all of them who were so kind to me will think I stole them. Oh, do have mercy upon me, and send them back!”</div>
<div class="tx">With those words, which were uttered with all the energy of passionate grief, Oliver fell upon his knees at the Jew’s feet, and beat his hands together in perfect desperation.</div>
<div class="tx">“The boy’s right,” remarked Fagin, looking covertly round, and knitting his shaggy eyebrows into a hard knot. “You’re right, Oliver, you’re right: they <i>will</i> think you have stolen ‘em. Ha! ha!” chuckled the Jew, rubbing his hands; “it couldn’t have happened better if we had chosen our time!”</div>
<div class="tx">“Of course it couldn‘t,” replied Sikes; “I know’d that, directly I see him coming through Clerkenwell with the books under his arm. It’s all right enough. They’re soft-hearted psalm-singers, or they wouldn’t have taken him in at all; and they’ll ask no questions after him, fear they should be obliged to prosecute, and so get him lagged. He’s safe enough.”</div>
<div class="tx">Oliver had looked from one to the other, while these words were being spoken, as if he were bewildered, and could scarcely understand what passed; but when Bill Sikes concluded, he jumped suddenly to his feet, and tore wildly from the room: uttering shrieks for help, which made the bare old house echo to the roof.</div>
<div class="tx">“Keep back the dog, Bill!” cried Nancy, springing before the door, and closing it, as the Jew and his two pupils darted out in pursuit. “Keep back the dog; he’ll tear the boy to pieces.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Serve him right!” cried Sikes, struggling to disengage himself from the girl’s grasp. “Stand off from me, or I’ll split your head against the wall.”</div>
<div class="tx">“I don’t care for that, Bill, I don’t care for that,” screamed the girl, struggling violently with the man: “the child shan’t be torn down by the dog, unless you kill me first.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Shan’t he!” said Sikes, setting his teeth. “I’ll soon do that if you don’t keep off.”</div>
<div class="tx">The housebreaker flung the girl from him to the further end of the room, just as the Jew and the two boys returned, dragging Oliver among them.</div>
<div class="tx">“What’s the matter here!” said Fagin, looking round.</div>
<div class="tx">“The girl’s gone mad, I think,” replied Sikes, savagely.</div>
<div class="tx">“No, she hasn‘t,” said Nancy, pale and breathless from the scuffle; “no, she hasn’t, Fagin; don’t think it.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Then keep quiet, will you?” said the Jew, with a threatening look.</div>
<div class="tx">“No, I won’t do that, neither,” replied Nancy, speaking very loud. “Come! What do you think of that?”</div>
<div class="tx">Mr. Fagin was sufficiently well acquainted with the manners and customs of that particular species of humanity to which Nancy belonged, to feel tolerably certain that it would be rather unsafe to prolong any conversation with her, at present. With the view of diverting the attention of the company, he turned to Oliver.</div>
<div class="tx">“So you wanted to get away, my dear, did you?” said the Jew, taking up a jagged and knotted club which lay in a corner of the fireplace; “eh?”</div>
<div class="tx">Oliver made no reply. But he watched the Jew’s motions, and breathed quickly.</div>
<div class="tx">“Wanted to get assistance; called for the police, did you?” sneered the Jew, catching the boy by the arm. “We’ll cure you of that, my young master.”</div>
<div class="tx">The Jew inflicted a smart blow on Oliver’s shoulders with the club, and was raising it for a second when the girl, rushing forward, wrested it from his hand. She flung it into the fire with a force that brought some of the glowing coals whirling out into the room.</div>
<div class="tx">“I won’t stand by and see it done, Fagin,” cried the girl. “You’ve got the boy, and what more would you have?—Let him be—let him be—or I shall put that mark on some of you, that will bring me to the gallows before my time.”</div>
<div class="tx">The girl stamped her foot violently on the floor as she vented this threat, and with her lips compressed, and her hands clenched, looked alternately at the Jew and the other robber, her face quite colourless from the passion of rage into which she had gradually worked herself.</div>
<div class="tx">“Why, Nancy!” said the Jew, in a soothing tone, after a pause, during which he and Mr. Sikes had stared at one another in a disconcerted manner; “you—you’re more clever  than ever tonight Ha! ha! my dear, you are acting beautifully.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Am I!” said the girl. “Take care I don’t overdo it. You will be the worse for it, Fagin, if I do; and so I tell you in good time to keep clear of me.”</div>
<div class="tx">There is something about a roused woman—especially if she add to all her other strong passions, the fierce impulses of recklessness and despair—which few men like to provoke. The Jew saw that it would be hopeless to affect any further mistake regarding the reality of Miss Nancy’s rage and, shrinking involuntarily back a few paces, cast a glance, half imploring and half cowardly at Sikes, as if to hint that he was the fittest person to pursue the dialogue.</div>
<div class="tx">Mr. Sikes, thus mutely appealed to, and possibly feeling his personal pride and influence interested in the immediate reduction of Miss Nancy to reason, gave utterance to about a couple of score of curses and threats, the rapid production of which reflected great credit on the fertility of his invention. As they produced no visible effect on the object against whom they were discharged, however, he resorted to more tangible arguments.</div>
<div class="tx">“What do you mean by this?” said Sikes, backing the inquiry with a very common imprecation concerning the most beautiful of human features, which, if it were heard above only once out of every fifty thousand times that it is uttered below, would render blindness as common a disorder as measles: “what do you mean by it? Burn my body! Do you know who you are, and what you are?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Oh, yes, I know all about it,” replied the girl, laughing hysterically and shaking her head from side to side, with a poor assumption of indifference.</div>
<div class="tx">“Well, then, keep quiet,” rejoined Sikes, with a growl like that he was accustomed to use when addressing his dog, “or I’ll quiet you for a good long time to come.”</div>
<div class="tx">The girl laughing again, even less composedly than before, and darting a hasty look at Sikes, turned her face aside and bit her lip till the blood came.</div>
<div class="tx">“You’re a nice one,” added Sikes, as he surveyed her with a contemptuous air, “to take up the humane and gen—teel side!  A pretty subject for the child, as you call him, to make a friend of!”</div>
<div class="tx">“God Almighty help me, I am!” cried the girl passionately; “and I wish I had been struck dead in the street, or had changed places with them we passed so near tonight, before I had lent a hand in bringing him here. He’s a thief, a liar, a devil, all that’s bad, from this night forth. Isn’t that enough for the old wretch, without blows?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Come, come, Sikes,” said the Jew, appealing to him in a remonstratory tone, and motioning towards the boys, who were eagerly attentive to all that passed; “we must have civil words; civil words, Bill.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Civil words!” cried the girl, whose passion was frightful to see. “Civil words, you villain! Yes, you deserve ‘em from me. I thieved for you when I was a child not half as old as this!” pointing to Oliver. “I have been in the same trade, and in the same service, for twelve years since. Don’t you know it? Speak out! Don’t you know it?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Well, well,” replied the Jew, with an attempt at pacification; “and, if you have, it’s your living!”</div>
<div class="tx">“Aye, it is!” returned the girl, not speaking, but pouring out the words in one continuous and vehement scream. “It is my living; and the cold, wet, dirty streets are my home; and you’re the wretch that drove me to them long ago, and that’ ll keep me there, day and night, day and night, till I die!”</div>
<div class="tx">“I shall do you a mischief!” interposed the Jew, goaded by these reproaches; “a mischief worse than that, if you say much more!”</div>
<div class="tx">The girl said nothing more; but, tearing her hair and dress in a transport of passion, made such a rush at the Jew as would probably have left signal marks of her revenge upon him, had not her wrists been seized by Sikes at the right moment; upon which, she made a few ineffectual struggles, and fainted.</div>
<div class="tx">“She’s all right now,” said Sikes, laying her down in a corner. “She’s uncommon strong in the arms, when she’s up in this way.”</div>
<div class="tx">The Jew wiped his forehead and smiled, as if it were a relief to have the disturbance over, but neither he, nor Sikes, nor the  dog, nor the boys, seemed to consider it in any other light than a common occurrence incidental to business.</div>
<div class="tx">“It’s the worst of having to do with women,” said the Jew, replacing his club, “but they’re clever, and we can’t get on, in our line, without ‘em. Charley, show Oliver to bed.”</div>
<div class="tx">“I suppose he’d better not wear his best clothes tomorrow, Fagin, had he?” inquired Charley Bates.</div>
<div class="tx">“Certainly not,” replied the Jew, reciprocating the grin with which Charley put the question.</div>
<div class="tx">Master Bates, apparently much delighted with his commission, took the cleft stick and led Oliver into an adjacent kitchen, where there were two or three of the beds on which he had slept before; and here, with many uncontrollable bursts of laughter, he produced the identical old suit of clothes which Oliver had so much congratulated himself upon leaving off at Mr. Brownlow‘s, and the accidental display of which to Fagin, by the Jew who purchased them, had been the very first clue received of his whereabout.</div>
<div class="tx">“Pull off the smart ones,” said Charley, “and I’ll give ‘em to Fagin to take care of. What fun it is!”</div>
<div class="tx">Poor Oliver unwillingly complied. Master Bates, rolling up the new clothes under his arm, departed from the room, leaving Oliver in the dark and locking the door behind him.</div>
<div class="tx">The noise of Charley’s laughter, and the voice of Miss Betsy, who opportunely arrived to throw water over her friend and perform other feminine offices for the promotion of her recovery, might have kept many people awake under more happy circumstances than those in which Oliver was placed. But he was sick and weary; and he soon fell sound asleep.</div>
