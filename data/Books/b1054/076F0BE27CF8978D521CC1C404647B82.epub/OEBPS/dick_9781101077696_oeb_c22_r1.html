<div class="ct"><b><i>CHAPTER XXII</i></b></div>
<div class="ctag1"><i>The Burglary.</i></div>
<div> <br/></div><div class="tx1">“HALLO!” CRIED A LOUD, HOARSE VOICE, AS SOON AS THEY SET foot in the passage.</div>
<div class="tx">“Don’t make such a row,” said Sikes, bolting the door. “Show a glim, Toby.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Aha! my pal!” cried the same voice. “A glim, Barney, a glim! Show the gentleman in, Barney ; wake up first, if convenient.”</div>
<div class="tx">The speaker appeared to throw a boot-jack, or some such article, at the person he addressed, to rouse him from his slumbers ; for the noise of a wooden body, falling violently, was heard, and then an indistinct muttering, as of a man between asleep and awake.</div>
<div class="tx">“Do you hear?” cried the same voice. “There’s Bill Sikes in the passage with nobody to do the civil to him, and you sleeping there as if you took laudanum with your meals, and nothing stronger. Are you any fresher now, or do you want the iron candlestick to wake you thoroughly?”</div>
<div class="tx">A pair of slipshod feet shuffled hastily across the bare floor of the room as this interrogatory was put; and there issued, from a door on the right hand: first a feeble candle, and next, the form of the same individual who has been heretofore described as labouring under the infirmity of speaking through his nose, and officiating as waiter at the public-house on Saffron Hill.</div>
<div class="tx">“Bister Sikes!” exclaimed Barney, with real or counterfeit joy; “cub id, sir; cub id.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Here! you get on first,” said Sikes, putting Oliver in front of him. “Quicker! or I shall tread upon your heels.”</div>
<div class="tx">Muttering a curse upon his tardiness, Sikes pushed Oliver before him; and they entered a low dark room with a smoky fire, two or three broken chairs, a table, and a very old couch, on which, with his legs much higher than his head, a man was reposing at full length, smoking a long clay pipe. He was dressed in a smartly cut snuff-coloured coat with large brass buttons; an orange neckerchief; a coarse, staring, shawl-pattern waistcoat; and drab breeches. Mr. Crackit (for he it was) had no very great quantity of hair, either upon his head or face; but what he had was of a reddish dye, and tortured into long corkscrew curls, through which he occasionally thrust some very dirty fingers, ornamented with large common rings. He was a trifle above the middle size, and apparently rather weak in the legs; but this circumstance by no means detracted from his.own admiration of his top-boots, which he contemplated, in their elevated situation, with lively satisfaction.</div>
<div class="tx">“Bill, my boy!” said this figure, turning his head towards the door, “I’m glad to see you. I was almost afraid you’d given it up, in which case I should have made a personal wentur. Hallo!”</div>
<div class="tx">Uttering this exclamation in a tone of great surprise, as his eye rested on Oliver, Mr. Toby Crackit brought himself into a sitting posture, and demanded who that was.</div>
<div class="tx">“The boy. Only the boy!” replied Sikes, drawing a chair towards the fire.</div>
<div class="tx">“Wud of Bister Fagid’s lad,” exclaimed Barney, with a grin.</div>
<div class="tx">“Fagin‘s, eh!” exclaimed Toby, looking at Oliver. “Wot an inwalable boy that’ll make, for the old ladies’ pockets in chapels! His mug is a fortun’ to him.”</div>
<div class="tx">“There—there’s enough of that,” interposed Sikes, impatiently; and stooping over his recumbent friend, he whispered a few words in his ear, at which Mr. Crackit laughed immensely, and honoured Oliver with a long stare of astonishment.</div>
<div class="tx">“Now,” said Sikes, as he resumed his seat, “if you’ll give us something to eat and drink while we’re waiting, you’ll put some heart in us, or in me, at all events. Sit down by the fire, younker, and rest yourself; for you’ll have to go out with us again tonight, though not very far off.”</div>
<div class="tx">Oliver looked at Sikes in mute and timid wonder, and drawing a stool to the fire, sat with his aching head upon his hands, scarcely knowing where he was, or what was passing around him.</div>
<div class="tx">“Here,” said Toby, as the young Jew placed some fragments of food, and a bottle upon the table. “Success to the crack!” He rose to honour the toast and, carefully depositing his empty pipe in a corner, advanced to the table, filled a glass with spirits, and drank off its contents. Mr. Sikes did the same.</div>
<div class="tx">“A drain for the boy,” said Toby, half-filling a wine glass. “Down with it, innocence.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Indeed,” Said Oliver, looking piteously up into the man’s face; “indeed, I—”</div>
<div class="tx">“Down with it!” echoed Toby. “Do you think I don’t know what’s good for you? Tell him to drink it, Bill.”</div>
<div class="tx">“He had better!” said Sikes, clapping his hand upon his pocket. “Burn my body, if he isn’t more trouble than a whole family of Dodgers. Drink it, you perwerse imp; drink it!”</div>
<div class="tx">Frightened by the menacing gestures of the two men, Oliver hastily swallowed the contents of the glass and immediately fell into a violent fit of coughing, which delighted Toby Crackit and Barney and even drew a smile from the surly Mr. Sikes.</div>
<div class="tx">This done, and Sikes having satisfied his appetite (Oliver could eat nothing but a small crust of bread which they made him swallow), the two men laid themselves down on chairs for a short nap. Oliver retained his stool by the fire; Barney, wrapped in a blanket, stretched himself on the floor, close outside the fender.</div>
<div class="tx">They slept, or appeared to sleep, for some time, nobody stirring but Barney, who rose once or twice to throw coals upon the fire. Oliver fell into a heavy doze, imagining himself straying along the gloomy lanes or wandering about the dark churchyard, or retracing some one or other of the scenes of the past day, when he was roused by Toby Crackit jumping up and declaring it was half-past one.</div>
<div class="tx">In an instant the other two were on their legs, and all were actively engaged in busy preparation. Sikes and his companion enveloped their necks and chins in large dark shawls, and  drew on their greatcoats; Barney, opening a cupboard, brought forth several articles which he hastily crammed into the pockets.</div>
<div class="tx">“Barkers for me, Barney,” said Toby Crackit.</div>
<div class="tx">“Here they are,” replied Barney, producing a pair of pistols. “You loaded them yourself.”</div>
<div class="tx">“All right!” replied Toby, stowing them away. “The per suaders?”</div>
<div class="tx">“I’ve got ‘em,” replied Sikes.</div>
<div class="tx">“Crape, keys, centre-bits, darkies—nothing forgotten?” inquired Toby, fastening a small crowbar to a loop inside the skirt of his coat.</div>
<div class="tx">“All right,” rejoined his companion. “Bring them bits of timber. Barney. That’s the time of day.”</div>
<div class="tx">With these words, he took a thick stick from Barney’s hands, who, having delivered another to Toby, busied himself in fastening on Oliver’s cape.</div>
<div class="tx">“Now then!” said Sikes, holding out his hand.</div>
<div class="tx">Oliver, who was completely stupefied by the unwonted exercise, and the air, and the drink which had been forced upon him, put his hand mechanically into that which Sikes extended for the purpose.</div>
<div class="tx">“Take his other hand, Toby,” said. Sikes. “Look out, Barney.”</div>
<div class="tx">The man went to the door, and returned to announce that all was quiet. The two robbers issued forth with Oliver between them. Barney, having made all fast, rolled himself up as before, and was soon asleep again.</div>
<div class="tx">It was now intensely dark. The fog was much heavier than it had been in the early part of the night; and the atmosphere was so damp, that, although no rain fell, Oliver’s hair and eyebrows, within a few minutes after leaving the house, had become stiff with the half-frozen moisture that was floating about. They crossed the bridge, and kept on towards the lights which he had seen before. They were at no great distance off; and, as they walked pretty briskly, they soon arrived at Chertsey.</div>
<div class="tx">“Slap through the town,” whispered Sikes; “there’ll be nobody in the way to-night to see us.”</div>
<div class="tx">Toby acquiesced; and they hurried through the main street of the little town, which at that late hour was wholly deserted. A dim light shone at intervals from some bedroom window, and the hoarse barking of dogs occasionally broke the silence of the night. But there was nobody abroad. They had cleared the town, as the churchbell struck two.</div>
<div class="tx">Quickening their pace, they turned up a road upon the left hand. After walking about a quarter of a mile, they stopped before a detached house surrounded by a wall, to the top of which, Toby Crackit, scarcely pausing to take breath, climbed in a twinkling.</div>
<div class="tx">“The boy next,” said Toby. “Hoist him up; I’ll catch hold of him.”</div>
<div class="tx">Before Oliver had time to look round, Sikes had caught him under the arms; and in three or four seconds he and Toby were lying on the grass on the other side. Sikes followed directly. And they stole cautiously towards the house.</div>
<div class="tx">And now, for the first time, Oliver, well-nigh mad with grief and terror, saw that housebreaking and robbery, if not murder, were the objects of the expedition. He clasped his hands together, and involuntarily uttered a subdued exclamation of horror. A mist came before his eyes; the cold sweat stood upon his ashy face; his limbs failed him; and he sank upon his knees.</div>
<div class="tx">“Get up<sup>!</sup>” murmured Sikes, trembling with rage, and drawing the pistol from his pocket; “Get up, or I’ll strew your brains upon the grass.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Oh! for God’s sake let me go!” cried Oliver; “let me run away and die in the fields. I will never come near London; never, never! Oh! pray have mercy on me, and do not make me steal. For the love of all the bright Angels that rest in Heaven, have mercy upon me!”</div>
<div class="tx">The man to whom this appeal was made, swore a dreadful oath, and had cocked the pistol when Toby, striking it from his grasp, placed his hands upon the boy’s mouth and dragged him to the house.</div>
<div class="tx">“Hush!” cried the man; “it won’t answer here. Say another word, and I’ll do your business myself with a crack on the head. That makes no noise, and is quite as certain, and more  genteel. Here, Bill, wrench the shutter open. He’s game enough now, I’ll engage. I’ve seen older hands of his age took the same way, for a minute or two, on a cold night.”</div>
<div class="tx">Sikes, invoking terrific imprecations upon Fagin’s head for sending Oliver on such an errand, plied the crowbar vigorously, but with little noise. After some delay, and some assistance from Toby, the shutter to which he had referred swung open on its hinges.</div>
<div class="tx">It was a little lattice window, about five feet and a half above the ground, at the back of the house, which belonged to a scullery, or small brewing-place, at the end of the passage. The aperture was so small that the inmates had probably not thought it worth while to defend it more securely; but it was large enough to admit a boy of Oliver’s size, nevertheless. A very brief exercise of Mr. Sikes’s art sufficed to overcome the fastening of the lattice, and it soon stood wide open also.</div>
<div class="tx">“Now listen, you young limb,” whispered Sikes, drawing a dark lantern from his pocket, and throwing the glare full on Oliver’s face; “I’m a going to put you through there. Take this light; go softly up the steps straight afore you, and along the little hall, to the street door; unfasten it, and let us in.”</div>
<div class="tx">“There’s a bolt at the top, you won’t be able to reach,” interposed Toby. “Stand upon one of the hall chairs. There are three there, Bill, with a jolly large blue unicorn and gold pitchfork on ‘em, which is the old lady’s arms.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Keep quiet, can’t you?” replied Sikes, with a threatening look. “The room-door is open, is it?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Wide,” replied Toby, after peeping in to satisfy himself. “The game of that is, that they always leave it open with a catch, so that the dog, who’s got a bed in here, may walk up and down the passage when he feels wakeful. Ha! ha! Barney ‘ticed him away to-night. So neat!”</div>
<div class="tx">Although Mr. Crackit spoke in a scarcely audible whisper, and laughed without noise, Sikes imperiously commanded him to be silent, and to get to work. Toby complied, by first producing his lantern and placing it on the ground, then by planting himself firmly with his head against the wall beneath the window, and his hands upon his knees, so as to make a step of his back. This was no sooner done than Sikes, mounting upon him,  put Oliver gently through the window with his feet first and. without leaving hold of his collar, planted him safely on the floor inside.</div>
<div class="tx">“Take this lantern,” said Sikes, looking into the room. “You see the stairs afore you?”</div>
<div class="tx">Oliver, more dead than alive, gasped out, “Yes.” Sikes, pointing to the street-door with the pistol-barrel, briefly advised him to take notice that he was within shot all the way, and that if he faltered he would fall dead that instant.</div>
<div class="tx">“It’s done in a minute,” said Sikes, in the same low whisper. “Directly I leave go of you, do your work. Hark!”</div>
<div class="tx">“What’s that?” whispered the other man.</div>
<div class="tx">They listened intently.</div>
<div class="tx">“Nothing,” said Sikes, releasing his hold of Oliver. “Now!”</div>
<div class="tx">In the short time he had had to collect his senses, the boy had firmly resolved that, whether he died in the attempt or not, he would make one effort to dart upstairs from the hall and alarm the family. Filled with this idea, he advanced at once, but stealthily.</div>
<div class="tx">“Come back!” suddenly cried Sikes aloud. “Back! back!”</div>
<div class="tx">Scared by the sudden breaking of the dead stillness of the place, and by a loud cry which followed it, Oliver let his lantern fall, and knew not whether to advance or fly.</div>
<div class="tx">The cry was repeated—a light appeared—a vision of two terrified half-dressed men at the top of the stairs swam before his eyes—a flash—a loud noise—a smoke—a crash somewhere, but where he knew not—and he staggered back.</div>
<div class="tx">Sikes had disappeared for an instant; but he was up again, and had him by the collar before the smoke had cleared away. He fired his own pistol after the men, who were already retreating, and dragged the boy up.</div>
<div class="tx">“Clasp your arm tighter,” said Sikes, as he drew him through the window. “Give me a shawl here. They’ve hit him. Quick! How the boy bleeds!”</div>
<div class="tx">Then came the loud ringing of a bell, mingled with the noise of fire-arms, and the shouts of men, and the sensation of being carried over uneven ground at a rapid pace. And then the noises grew confused in the distance, and a cold deadly feeling crept over the boy’s heart, and he saw or heard no more.</div>
