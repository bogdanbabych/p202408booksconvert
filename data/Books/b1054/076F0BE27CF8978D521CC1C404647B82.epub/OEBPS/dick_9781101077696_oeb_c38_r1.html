<div class="ct"><b><i>CHAPTER XXXVIII</i></b></div>
<div class="ctag1"><i>Containing an account of what passed between</i>  <br/><i>Mr. and Mrs. Bumble and Mr. Monks</i>  <br/><i>at their nocturnal interview.</i></div>
<div> <br/></div><div class="tx1">IT WAS A DULL, CLOSE, OVERCAST SUMMER EVENING. THE clouds, which had been threatening all day, spread out in a dense and sluggish mass of vapour, already yielded large drops of rain, and seemed to presage a violent thunder-storm, when Mr. and Mrs. Bumble, turning out of the main street of the town, directed their course towards a scattered little colony of ruinous houses, distant from it some mile and a half or thereabouts, and erected on a low unwholesome swamp bordering upon the river.</div>
<div class="tx">They were both wrapped in old and shabby outer garments, which might, perhaps, serve the double purpose of protecting their persons from the rain and sheltering them from observation. The husband carried a lantern, from which, however, no light yet shone; and trudged on, a few paces in front, as though—the way being dirty—to give his wife the benefit of treading in his heavy footprints. They went on, in profound silence; every now and then Mr. Bumble relaxed his pace and turned his head as if to make sure that his helpmate was following; then, discovering that she was close at his heels, he mended his rate of walking and proceeded. at a considerable increase of speed, towards their place of destination.</div>
<div class="tx">This was far from being a place of doubtful character; for it had long been known as the residence of none but low ruffians, who, under various pretences of living by their labour, subsisted chiefly on plunder and crime. It was a collection of mere hovets—some hastily built with loose bricks, others, of old worm-eaten ship-timber—jumbled together without any attempt at order or arrangement, and planted, for the most part,  within a few feet of the river’s bank. A few leaky boats drawn up on the mud and made fast to the dwarf wall which skirted it, and here and there an oar or coil of rope, appeared at first to indicate that the inhabitants of these miserable cottages pursued some avocation on the river; but a glance at the shattered and useless condition of the articles thus displayed would have led a passer-by, without much difficulty, to the conjecture that they were disposed there rather for the preservation of appearances than with any view to their being actually employed.</div>
<div class="tx">In the heart of this cluster of huts, and skirting the river, which its upper stories overhung, stood a large building, formerly used as a manufactory of some kind. It had, in its day, probably furnished employment to the inhabitants of the surrounding tenements. But it had long since gone to ruin. The rat, the worm, and the action of the damp had weakened and rotted the piles on which it stood; and a considerable portion of the building had already sunk down into the water, while the remainder, tottering and bending over the dark stream, seemed to wait a favourable opportunity of following its old companion and involving itself in the same fate.</div>
<div class="tx">It was before this ruinous building that the worthy couple paused as the first peal of distant thunder reverberated in the air, and the rain commenced pouring violently down.</div>
<div class="tx">“The place should be somewhere here,” said Bumble, consulting a scrap of paper he held in his hand.</div>
<div class="tx">“Halloa there!” cried a voice from above.</div>
<div class="tx">Following the sound, Mr. Bumble raised his head and descried a man looking out of a door, breast-high, on the second story.</div>
<div class="tx">“Stand still, a minute,” cried the voice; “I’ll be with you directly.” With which the head disappeared and the door closed.</div>
<div class="tx">“Is that the man?” asked Mr. Bumble’s good lady.</div>
<div class="tx">Mr. Bumble nodded in the affirmative.</div>
<div class="tx">“Then mind what I told you.” said the matron, “and be careful to say as little as you can, or you’ll betray us at once.”</div>
<div class="tx">Mr. Bumble, who had eyed the building with very rueful looks, was apparently about to express some doubts relative to the advisability of proceeding any further with the enterprise just then, when he was prevented by the appearance of Monks,  who opened a small door, near which they stood, and beckoned them inwards.</div>
<div class="tx">“Come in!” he cried impatiently, stamping his foot upon the ground. “Don’t keep me here!”</div>
<div class="tx">The woman, who had hesitated at first, walked boldly in without any other invitation. Mr. Bumble, who was ashamed or afraid to lag behind, followed, obviously very ill at ease and with scarcely any of that remarkable dignity which was usually his chief characteristic.</div>
<div class="tx">“What the devil made you stand lingering there in the wet?” said Monks, turning round and addressing Bumble, after he had bolted the door behind them.</div>
<div class="tx">“We—we were only cooling ourselves,” stammered Bumble, looking apprehensively about him.</div>
<div class="tx">“Cooling yourselves!” retorted Monks. “Not all the rain that ever fell, or ever will fall, will put as much of hell’s fire out as a man can carry about with him. You won’t cool yourselves so easily; don’t think it!”</div>
<div class="tx">With this agreeable speech, Monks turned short upon the matron and bent his gaze upon her till even she, who was not easily cowed, was fain to withdraw her eyes and turn them towards the ground.</div>
<div class="tx">“This is the woman, is it?” demanded Monks.</div>
<div class="tx">“Hem! That is the woman,” replied Mr. Bumble, mindful of his wife’s caution.</div>
<div class="tx">“You think women never can keep secrets, I suppose?” said the matron, interposing, and returning, as she spoke, the searching looks of Monks.</div>
<div class="tx">“I know they will always keep <i>one</i> till it’s found out,” said Monks.</div>
<div class="tx">“And what may that be?” asked the matron.</div>
<div class="tx">“The loss of their own good name,” replied Monks. “So, by the same rule, if a woman’s a party to a secret that might hang or transport her, I’m not afraid of her telling it to anybody, not I! Do you understand, mistress?”</div>
<div class="tx">“No,” rejoined the matron, slightly colouring as she spoke.</div>
<div class="tx">“Of course you don‘t!” said Monks. “How should you?”</div>
<div class="tx">Bestowing something half-way between a smile and a frown upon his two companions, and again beckoning them to  follow him, the man hastened across the apartment, which was of considerable extent but low in the roof. He was preparing to ascend a steep staircase, or rather ladder, leading to another floor of warehouses above, when a bright flash of lightning streamed down the aperture, and a peal of thunder followed, which shook the crazy building to its centre.</div>
<div class="tx">“Hear it!” he cried, shrinking back. “Hear it! Rolling and crashing on as if it echoed through a thousand caverns where the devils were hiding from it. I hate the sound!”</div>
<div class="tx">He remained silent for a few moments; and then, removing his hands suddenly from his face, showed, to the unspeakable discomposure of Mr. Bumble, that it was much distorted, and discoloured.</div>
<div class="tx">“These fits come over me, now and then,” said Monks, observing his alarm; “and thunder sometimes brings them on. Don’t mind me now; it’s all over for this once.”</div>
<div class="tx">Thus speaking, he led the way up the ladder and, hastily closing the window-shutter of the room into which it led, lowered a lantern which hung at the end of a rope and pulley passed through one of the heavy beams in the ceiling, and which cast a dim light up on an old table and three chairs that were placed beneath it.</div>
<div class="tx">“Now,” said Monks, when they had all three seated themselves, “the sooner we come to our business, the better for all. The woman knows what it is, does she?”</div>
<div class="tx">The question was addressed to Bumble, but his wife anticipated the reply by intimating that she was perfectly acquainted with it.</div>
<div class="tx">“He is right in saying that you were with this hag the night she died, and that she told you something—”</div>
<div class="tx">“About the mother of the boy you named,” replied the matron interrupting him. “Yes.”</div>
<div class="tx">“The first question is, of what nature was her communication?” said Monks.</div>
<div class="tx">“That’s the second,” observed the woman with much deliberation. “The first is, what may the communication be worth?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Who the devil can tell that, without knowing of what kind it is?” asked Monks.</div>
<div class="tx">“Nobody better than you, I am persuaded,” answered Mrs.  Bumble, who did not want for spirit, as her yoke-fellow could abundantly testify.</div>
<div class="tx">“Humph!” said Monks significantly, and with a look of eager inquiry; “there may be money’s worth to get, eh?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Perhaps there may,” was the composed reply.</div>
<div class="tx">“Something that was taken from her,” said Monks. “Something that she wore. Something that—”</div>
<div class="tx">“You had better bid,” interrupted Mrs. Bumble. “I have heard enough, already, to assure me that you are the man I ought to talk to.”</div>
<div class="tx">Mr. Bumble, who had not yet been admitted by his better half into any greater share of the secret than he had originally possessed, listened to this dialogue with outstretched neck and distended eyes, which he directed towards his wife and Monks, by turns, in undisguised astonishment—increased, if possible, when the latter sternly demanded what sum was required for the disclosure.</div>
<div class="tx">“What’s it worth to you?” asked the woman, as collectedly as before.</div>
<div class="tx">“It may be nothing; it may be twenty pounds,” replied Monks. “Speak, out, and let me know which.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Add five pounds to the sum you have named; give me five-and-twenty pounds in gold,” said the woman; “and I’ll tell you all I know. Not before.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Five”-and-twenty pounds!” exclaimed Monks, drawing back.</div>
<div class="tx">“I spoke as plainly as I could,” replied Mrs. Bumble. “It’s not a large sum, either.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Not a large sum for a paltry secret that may be nothing when it’s told!” cried Monks impatiently; “and which has been lying dead for twelve years past or more!”</div>
<div class="tx">“Such matters keep well and, like good wine, often double their value in course of time,” answered the matron, still preserving the resolute indifference she had assumed. “As to lying dead, there are those who will lie dead for twelve thousand years to come, or twelve million, for anything you or I know, who will tell strange tales at last!”</div>
<div class="tx">“What if I pay it for nothing?” asked Monks, hesitating.</div>
<div class="tx">“You can easily take it away again,” replied the matron. “I am but a woman, alone here, and unprotected.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Not alone, my dear, nor unprotected neither,” submitted Mr. Bumble, in a voice tremulous with fear: <i>“I</i> am here, my dear. And besides,” said Mr. Bumble, his teeth chattering as he spoke, “Mr. Monks is too much of a gentleman to attempt any violence on porochial persons. Mr. Monks is aware that I am not a young man. my dear, and also that I am a little run to seed, as I may say; but he has heerd—I say I have no doubt Mr. Monks has heerd, my dear—that! I am a very determined officer, with very uncommon strength. if I’m once roused. I only want a little rousing, that’s all.”</div>
<div class="tx">As Mr. Bumble spoke, he made a melancholy feint of grasping his lantern with fierce determination, and plainly showed, by the alarmed expression of every feature, that he  <i>did</i> want a little rousing, and not a little, prior to making any very warlike demonstration, unless, indeed, against paupers, or other person or persons trained down for the purpose.</div>
<div class="tx">“You are a fool,” said Mrs. Bumble, in reply; “and had better hold your tongue.”</div>
<div class="tx">“He had better have cut it out before he came, if he can’t speak in a lower tone,” said Monks, grimly. “So! He’s your husband,eh?”</div>
<div class="tx">“He’s my husband!” tittered the matron, parrying the question.</div>
<div class="tx">“I thought as much when you came in,” rejoined Monks, marking the angry glance which the lady darted at her spouse as she spoke. “So much the better; I have less hesitation in dealing with two people when I find that there’s only one will between them. I’m in earnest. See here!”</div>
<div class="tx">He thrust his hand into a side-pocket and, producing a canvas bag, told out twenty-five sovereigns on the table and pushed them over to the woman.</div>
<div class="tx">“Now,” he said, “gather them up; and when this cursed peal of thunder, which I feel is coming up to break over the house-top, is gone, let’s hear your story.”</div>
<div class="tx">The thunder, which seemed in fact much nearer, and to shiver and break almost over their heads, having subsided, Monks, raising his face from the table, bent forward to listen  to what the woman should say. The faces of the three nearly touched, as the two men leant over the small table in their eagerness to hear, and the woman also leant forward to render her whisper audible. The sickly rays of the suspended lantern falling directly upon them, aggravated the paleness and anxiety of their countenances, which, encircled by the deepest gloom and darkness, looked ghastly in the extreme.</div>
<div class="tx">“When this woman, that we called old Sally, died,” the matron began, “she and I were alone.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Was there no one by?” asked Monks, in the same hollow whisper; “no sick wretch or idiot in some other bed? No one who could hear, and might, by possibility, understand?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Not a soul,” replied the woman; “we were alone. <i>I</i> stood alone beside the body when death came over it.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Good,” said Monks, regarding her attentively. “Go on.”</div>
<div class="tx">“She spoke of a young creature,” resumed the matron, “who had brought a child into the world some years before, not merely in the same room, but in the same bed, in which she then lay dying.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Ay?” said Monks, with quivering lip, and glancing over his shoulder. “Blood! How things come about!”</div>
<div class="tx">“The child was the one you named to him last night,” said the matron, nodding carelessly towards her husband; “the mother this nurse had robbed.”</div>
<div class="tx">“In life?” asked Monks.</div>
<div class="tx">“In death,” replied the woman, with something like a shudder. “She stole from the corpse, when it had hardly turned to one, that which the dead mother had prayed her, with her last breath, to keep for the infant’s sake.”</div>
<div class="tx">“She sold it?” cried Monks, with desperate eagerness; “did she sell it? Where? When? To whom? How long before?”</div>
<div class="tx">“As she told me, with great difficulty, that she had done this,” said the matron, “she fell back and died.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Without saying more?” cried Monks, in a voice which, from its very suppression, seemed only the more furious. “It’s a lie! I‘Il not be played with. She said more. I’ll tear the life out of you both, but I’ ll know what it was.”</div>
<div class="tx">“She didn’t utter another word,” said the woman, to all appearance unmoved (as Mr. Bumble was very far from being)  by the strange man’s violence; “but she clutched my gown, violently, with one hand, which was partly closed; and when I saw that she was dead, and so removed the hand by force, I found it clasped a scrap of dirty paper.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Which contained—” interposed Monks, stretching forward.</div>
<div class="tx">“Nothing,” replied the woman; “it was a pawnbroker’s duplicate.”</div>
<div class="tx">“For what?” demanded Monks.</div>
<div class="tx">“In good time I’ll tell you,” said the woman. “I judge that she had kept the trinket for some time in the hope of turning it to better account and then had pawned it, and had saved or scraped together money to pay the pawnbroker’s interest year by year and prevent its running out, so that if anything came of it, it could still be redeemed. Nothing had come of it; and, as I tell you, she died with the scrap of paper, all worn and tattered, in her hand. The time was out in two days; I thought something might one day come of it too, and so redeemed the pledge.”</div>
<div class="tx">“Where is it now?” asked Monks quickly.</div>
<div class="tx"><i>“There,”</i> replied the woman. And, as if glad to be relieved of it, she hastily threw upon the table a small kid bag scarcely large enough for a French watch, which Monks pouncing upon, tore open with trembling hands. It contained a little gold locket, in which were two locks of hair and a plain gold wedding-ring.</div>
<div class="tx">“It has the word ‘Agnes’ engraved on the inside,” said the woman. “There is a blank left for the surname; and then follows the date, which is within a year before the child was born. I found out that.”</div>
<div class="tx">“And this is all?” said Monks, after a close and eager scrutiny of the contents of the little packet.</div>
<div class="tx">“All,” replied the woman.</div>
<div class="tx">Mr. Bumble drew a long breath, as if he were glad to find that the story was over, and.no mention made of taking the five-and-twenty pounds back again; and now he took courage to wipe off the perspiration which had been trickling over his nose, unchecked, during the whole of the previous dialogue.</div>
<div class="tx">“I know nothing of the story, beyond what I can guess at,”  said his wife addressing Monks, after a short silence; “and I want to know nothing, for it’s safer not. But I may ask you two questions, may I?”</div>
<div class="tx">“You may ask,” said Monks, with some show of surprise; “but whether I answer or not is another question.”</div>
<div class="tx">“—Which makes three.” observed Mr. Bumble, essaying a stroke of facetiousness.</div>
<div class="tx">“Is that what you expected to get from me?” demanded the matron.</div>
<div class="tx">“It is,” replied Monks. “The other question?”</div>
<div class="tx">“What you propose to do with it? Can it be used against me?”</div>
<div class="tx">“Never,” rejoined Monks; “nor against me either. See here! But don’t move a step forward, or your life is not worth a bulrush.”</div>
<div class="tx">With these words he suddenly wheeled the table aside and, pulling an iron ring in the boarding, threw back a large trap-door which opened close at Mr. Bumble’s feet and caused that gentleman to retire several paces backward with great precipitation.</div>
<div class="tx">“Look down,” said Monks, lowering the lantern into the gulf. “Don’t fear me. I could have let you down, quietly enough, when you were seated over it, if that had been my game.”</div>
<div class="tx">Thus encouraged, the matron drew near to the brink; and even Mr. Bumble himself, impelled by curiosity, ventured to do the same. The turbid water, swollen by the heavy rain, was rushing rapidly on below; and all other sounds were lost in the noise of its splashing and eddying against the green and slimy piles. There had once been a water-mill beneath; the tide foaming and chafing round the few rotten stakes, and fragments of machinery that yet remained, seemed to dart onward, with a new impulse, when freed from the obstacles which had unavailingly attempted to stem its headlong course.</div>
<div class="tx">“If you flung a man’s body down there, where would it be to-morrow morning?” said Monks, swinging the lantern to and fro in the dark well.</div>
<div class="tx">“Twelve miles down the river, and cut to pieces besides,” replied Bumble, recoiling at the thought.</div>
<div class="tx">Monks drew the little packet from his breast, where he had hurriedly thrust it, and tying it to a leaden weight, which had formed a part of some pulley and was lying on the floor, dropped it into the stream. It fell straight, and true as a die, clove the water with a scarcely audible splash, and was gone.</div>
<div class="tx">The three, looking into each other’s faces, seemed to breathe more freely.</div>
<div class="tx">“There!” said Monks, closing the trap-door, which fell heavily back into its former position. “If the sea ever gives up its dead, as books say it will, it will keep its gold and silver to itself, and that trash among it. We have nothing more to say, and may break up our pleasant party.”</div>
<div class="tx">“By all means,” observed Mr. Bumble, with great alacrity.</div>
<div class="tx">“You’ll keep a quiet tongue in your head, will you?” said Monks, with a threatening look. “I am not afraid of your wife.”</div>
<div class="tx">“You may depend upon me, young man,” answered Mr. Bumble, bowing himself gradually towards the ladder, with excessive politeness. “On everybody’s account, young man; on my own, you know, Mr. Monks.”</div>
<div class="tx">“I am glad, for your sake, to hear it,” remarked Monks. “Light your lantern! And get away from here as fast as you can.”</div>
<div class="tx">It was fortunate that the conversation terminated at this point, or Mr. Bumble, who had bowed himself to within six inches of the ladder, would infallibly have pitched headlong into the room below. He lighted his lantern from that which Monks had detached from the rope, and now carried in his hand; and making no effort to prolong the discourse, descended in silence, followed by his wife. Monks brought up the rear, after pausing on the steps to satisfy himself that there were no other sounds to be heard than the beating of the rain without and the rushing of the water.</div>
<div class="tx">They traversed the lower room slowly and with caution; for Monks started at every shadow, and Mr. Bumble, holding his lantern a foot above the ground, walked not only with remarkable care, but with a marvelously light step for a gentleman of his figure, looking nervously about him for hidden trap-doors. The gate at which they had entered was softly unfastened and  opened by Monks; merely exchanging a nod with their mysterious acquaintance, the married couple emerged into the wet and darkness outside.</div>
<div class="tx">They were no sooner gone than Monks, who appeared to entertain an invincible repugnance to being left alone, called to a boy who had been hidden somewhere below. Bidding him go first and bear the light, he returned to the chamber he had just quitted.</div>
