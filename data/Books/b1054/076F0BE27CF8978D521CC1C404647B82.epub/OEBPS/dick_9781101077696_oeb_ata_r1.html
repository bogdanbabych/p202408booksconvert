<div class="fmtx1">As a child, <b>Charles Dickens</b> (1812-70) came to know not only hunger and privation, but also the horror of the infamous debtors’ prison and the evils of child labor. A surprise legacy brought release from the nightmare of prison and “slave” factories and afforded Dickens the opportunity of two years’ formal schooling. He taught himself shorthand and worked as a parliamentary reporter until his writing career took off with the publication of Sketches by Boz (1836) and <i>The Pickwick Papers</i>  (1837). As a novelist and magazine editor, Dickens had a long run of serialized success through <i>Our Mutual Friend</i>  (1864-65). In later years, ill health slowed him down, but he continued his popular dramatic readings from his fiction to an adoring public, which included Queen Victoria. At his death, <i>The Mystery of Edwin Drood</i> remained unfinished.</div>
